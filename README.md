# Papers

This repository contains sources of the ISO C++ committee (WG21) related materials - papers, etc. - which I wrote or co-authored.

## Additional information

Papers in co-authorship with Ruslan Arutyunyan (P3179, P2769, P2500, etc.) are also stored
in https://github.com/rarutyun/iso_cpp_papers and are mostly developed there. Then I cherry-pick
the changes into this repository.
